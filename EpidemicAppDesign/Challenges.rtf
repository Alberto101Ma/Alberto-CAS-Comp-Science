\f0\fs24 \cf0 Unfortunately, there are several challenges that the app presents. Firstly, at the core design of the app, users of the app must be ok with the idea of their location being shown to others at all times, which might raise concerns to some people. However, no names are shown whatsoever, just the fact if one has the virus or not. Secondly, the \'93food\'94 service must actually be connected to a food provider. Given the current shortage of food shipping, the foodservice probably isn\'92t possible. Finally, last but not least, there is a problem with the \'93official testing centers\'94 list not being automated. If new centers emerge, who will add it to the list in the app? Will all the different centers agree to use the one app? What if they don\'92t? How can people be responsible for knowing the different labs that are emerging in the country?}
