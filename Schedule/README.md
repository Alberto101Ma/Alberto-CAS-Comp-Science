## README

I like to call this the "My Crossroads App". The reason why I included "my" is because this app only works with my specific schedule... very useful! In all seriousness, the purpose of the additions I made to this app (I built it on top of a previous project), is to automatically "guess" which Crossroads day it is (by checking what Crossroads day the day before was) and automatically updating the pickerView, so I don't have to! 


## Bugs
At this moment, I am currently unaware of any bugs, but I AM keeping track every morning to see if my pickerView automatically updates! 

## Obstacles
Regarding my "obstacles", I am FULLY aware that the final code could be a little bit more organized... That is a huge weakness of mine! I also am using a lot of "var's" instead of "let's", which is unfortunately another bad habit I am developing!
