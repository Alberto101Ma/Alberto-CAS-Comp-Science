## Original Features List!

So this is my original "feature list":

1. App retains user data of current day AFTER midnight
2. Lets user know what current Crossroads “Day” it is (a, b, or c)
3. The app automatically switches day from a to c, c to b, and b to a at midnight of all of weekdays
4. In the weekends as well as predetermined vacation days, the day DOESN’T switch
5. Allows the user to change the day, and the app still proceeds to automatically switch to the next day, without crashing
6. Incorporate in previous Schedule app

My actual project ended up becoming very similar to the original "To-Do List"! At the time of creating the list, I didn't exactly know how to approach automatically switching days, but my general idea of the project have remained identical. Also, I'm kind of sad that I never got around "checking predetermined vacation days", due to the project being more complicated than I expected. However, here is an "Updated "Features List" with more correct terminology (most of the stuff is still really the same..):

## Updated Features List

1. Recognize if the current day is a weekday or weekend (ESSENTIAL for the code to run!)
2. If the current day is a weekday, allow user to SAVE the current Crossroads "Day"
3.  Automatically update pickerView on the weekday AFTER the saved data (if the day before was an A Day,  the app automatically goes to a C Day. If the day was a C Day automatically goes to an A Day.. ect).
2. Allow user to select a different Crossroads Day on the pickerView and STILL be able to save that Crossroads Day (with the app, the day later, still able to auto-refresh to the correct Crossroads Day)!
5. SAVE whether or not the current day is a weekday or a weekend when "Finding Schedule"
4. Incorporate into previous project "Schedule App"
